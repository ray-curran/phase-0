# Numbers, Letters and Variables

* What does puts do?  
  puts prints the results to the console on a new line but returns nil. 

* What is an integer? What is a float?  
  An integer is a whole number with no decimals or decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points.

* What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?  
  Integer division always rounds down to the next whole number. Float division doesn't round and gives the answer with decimals. I'd explain this to someone who doesn't know anything about programming by using the example of buying concert tickets. The answer that matters would be the lowest whole number, since you wouldn't be able to buy part of a ticket. 

* Hours in a year  
''' puts 24 * 365 '''  

* Minutes in a decade  
''' puts 24 * 60 * 365 * 10 '''

* How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?  
  Addition uses the + sign, subtraction uses the - sign, multiplication uses *, and division uses the / sign.  

* What is the difference between integers and floats?  
  Integers are whole numbers with no decimal points, and floats are numbers with the decimal points.  

* What is the difference between integer and float division?  
   Integer division always rounds down to the next whole number. Float division doesn't round and gives the answer with decimals.  

* What are strings? Why and when would you use them?  
  Strings are groups of letters or characters. You'd use them to print words and text to the screen.  

* What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?  
  A local variable is a variable given local scope. You'd use them as variables that needed to be reused in your current scope. So if it's in a certain file or function, you'd want to use a local variable. 

* How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?  
  I thought it was good. I would have preferred to do more active exercises, but felt the reading was a good start.
