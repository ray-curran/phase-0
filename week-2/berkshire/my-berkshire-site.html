<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  - It was pretty exciting to see it all come together. It's nice to have it start to feel natural when you do some of the repetitive actions (like adding so many list elements with links). 

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  - This part was tough for me, since I'd gotten pretty used to just using <div> for everything. I still don't have a great handle on what elements to use where. I had to have one of the articles linked in an earlier exercise open to make sure I was using the right elements at the right time, like header, footer, and section that I used here. 

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  - This was hard to do. Both David and I seemed to want to jump on the formatting, but had to remind ourselves that we aren't quite there yet. 

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  - I think the best and worst thing about HTML is how repetitive it is. I think it'll make completing basic tasks like placing elements on the page pretty straightforward, but need to make sure I'm not zoning out and misspelling or missing tags. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  - I don't really have any tricks just yet. Only thing that's worked well so far is when I'm writing the html in sublime and can tab to complete the open/closing tags for certain elements. This definitely makes it quicker and cuts down the risk of me misspelling something.
