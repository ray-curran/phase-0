* What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
&nbsp;

1. Information Gathering - this stage entails finding out exactly what the site should include and who the directed audience is. You will also want to know the purpose and goals of the site. This would involve talking to the client directly to find out what their wish or feature list is. 
2. Planning - in this stage, you should create a site map so you aren't finding new requirements as you work. You can use different tools like drawing or specialized web tools to create a diagram that shows how the website flows. 
3. Design - here you should create a wireframe and get a rough idea of what the site looks like. There are several ways to do this, from putting it on paper to having an interactive example for the client to see. 
4. Development - here is where you would actually code the site itself, adding the HTML an CSS.
5. Testing and Delivery - in this stage, you would check all the links and developed tools, and get feedback from the client to make sure the intentions were met. 
6. Maintenance - this stage is continuous, updating with new content or changes as needed.

* What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
... My site's primary goal will be to showcase me and my projects/abilities to prospective employers or other developers. I want to make sure they get a good idea of what I can do from looking at the content as well as the design. The site will include links to my blogs, projects, contact information, social media information, and some pictures of me. 

* What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
... My target audience's interest will likely be what I have worked on in the past and what my skill set is. I'll need to make sure my site is both appealing and functional, and also make sure to clearly explain how my projects/blog demonstrate my abilities. 

* What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
... The primary action for my site would be to see my portfolio of projects and to contact me. I'll need to make sure these links are prominently displayed and easy to find. 

* What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
... The main thing that I found most important while learning about user experience was that it's not the same thing as usability. While that's part of the overall experience, a developer (and web designer) need to take into account the feeling an experience evokes as well as making it accessible to all users. It should be a pleasing experience to use your site regardless of the way someone gets to the site (whether that's on mobile, a tablet, or a computer).

* What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
... User experience design is making sure that the combination of usability, accessibility, and positive feelings that a user has when they are on your site. If any of these aspects is lacking, a competitor may have an edge over you. Users are less likely to continue to visit your site or use your services if they have a hard time or negative experience. 

* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
... I had a somewhat hard time getting the relative links to work for my site map image. Had to do quite a bit of edits and double checking to make sure the image was accessible in markdown. Rather than just using a website, which I have some experience doing, I needed to navigate between directories in my repo. I used ../imgs/site-map.png, which navigated from the directory in my repo where my reflection was saved to my actual site map image.
