# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge [by myself, with: ].
# We spent [#] hours on this challenge.

# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
# The require_relative statement checks that the file listed is available and can use data from it. 
# This differs from require because it can use a relative path rather than an absolute path.
require_relative 'state_data'

    # We are still perfecting our formula here. The speed is also affected
    # by additional factors we haven't added into this functionality.

- What are the differences between the two different hash syntaxes shown in the state_data file?
  One uses the rocket symbol and one uses a colon. The one with the colon automatically turns the keys into symbols.

- What does require_relative do? How is it different from require?
  Require relative makes sure the file listed is there. It is different from require because it allows you to 
  put a relative path. 

- What are some ways to iterate through a hash?
  My favorite is the each method, but you could also use a while loop or map, collect, etc. 

- When refactoring virus_effects, what stood out to you about the variables, if anything?
  That they were unnecessary. This took us a while to figure out. 

- What concept did you most solidify in this challenge?
  It was good to work through hashes again in Ruby now that we've jumped into javascript. I'm going to need
  to work harder to make sure I keep them both straight.
